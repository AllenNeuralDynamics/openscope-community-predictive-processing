# Experiment Summary

This page provides a comprehensive overview of all experiments conducted as part of the OpenScope Community Predictive Processing project. It includes links to detailed session notes for each completed experiment and indicates planned experiments for platforms where data collection has not yet begun.

## Overview by Platform

The project utilizes three complementary neural recording platforms, each offering unique capabilities for studying predictive processing. Below is a summary of experiments conducted on each platform.
