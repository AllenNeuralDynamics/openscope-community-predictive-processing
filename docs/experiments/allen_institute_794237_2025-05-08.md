- **Rig / Setup ID:** SLAP2
- **Stimulus version:** [523741b57359b8ad4ca7963611473fbb195ad010]( https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-community-predictive-processing/blob/523741b57359b8ad4ca7963611473fbb195ad010/code/stimulus-control/src/Standard_oddball_slap2.bonsai)
- **Protocol followed:** Glutamate imaging, 50 min experiment
- **Notes & Issues:**
    - Similar experiment as last time. This time we record all 3 behavior videos (eye, face, body) with HARP timestamps aligned with the other events.
    
    - Baseline: 2405 -> NbBaselineGrating * (1 * (0.343+0.343)) -> 27.49 min
    - Mismatch: 40 -> NbMismatchPerCondition * 4 * (0.343+0.343)) -> 1.829 min of oddballs
    - Mismatch during orientation tuning: 40 -> 14.63 min
    - Receptive field: 10 -> NbReceptiveFieldRepeats * ((0.25) * 149) -> 6.2 min of RF
    
    Total Expected duration = 50.16 min 
    Oddball occurs on average every  11s

    - Head fixation started at 13:55
    - Lot of issues with alignment of the eye tracking cameras. We managed at 14:25 to align the camera.
    - There is a fair amout of 2p cross talk to the behavior cameras. We will need to add a filter to remove it.
    - Otherwise all 3 cameras are functions.
    - Andrew is positioning imaging of dendrites at 2:40. 
    - Maedeh weighting on choices of dendrites.
