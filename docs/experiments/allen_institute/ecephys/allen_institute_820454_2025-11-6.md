# Experiment Session Notes

- **Mouse ID:*820454*
- **Date:*2025_11_06*
- **Experimenter:*Ryan Gillis*
- **Rig / Setup ID:*NP1*
- **Stimulus version:* Openscope_P3_v52 EPHYS_SESSION3_PROD_P3_SEQUENCE*
- **Protocol followed:*extracellular electrophysiology*
- **Notes & Issues:**
    - restarted all computers prior to putting the mouse on the rig
    - Ryan performed the insertion, Casey was shadowing and assisting
    - coated probes (5x dips) in CM-DiD
    - agarose + silicone oil application went smoothly
    - lots of membrane on all probes, some altered targets
    - all 6 probes inserted 
    - settled probes for 30 minutes after reaching 3000 micron depth
    - minor eye foam in corner at 1:28
        -pupil never obscured
    - Mouse walked a little (intermittent), no running. Stationary most of the experiment

## Data Access

- **DANDI Repository**: The data from this experiment has been uploaded to the DANDI Archive and is available at: [DANDI:001637/sub-820454](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/001637/draft/files?location=sub-820454&page=1)

- **Data Format**: Data is stored in Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format.

- **Code Ocean**: Raw data (unpackaged and largely unprocessed) can be accessed on Allen Institute's Code Ocean [*Public Collection* here](https://codeocean.allenneuraldynamics.org/collections/f7b909a8-e515-4016-94ac-5487c009f20d?page=1&filter=all)


- **Analysis Code**: To explore the structure of the NWB file and validate its contents, you can use the [intro_to_ephys_nwbs](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-community-predictive-processing/blob/main/docs/notebooks/intro_to_ephys_nwbs.ipynb) script in our repository.
