| Probe F | ACA Mos |

    - first instance of using Openscope_P3_v52
    -mouse had silicone plug removal the previous Friday (membrane regrowth expected)
    - restarted all computers prior to putting the mouse on the rig
    - Ryan performed the insertion, Casey was shadowing and assisting
    - coated probes (5x dips) in CM-DiI
    - agarose + silicone oil application went smoothly
    - targeting went okay, lots of membrane on all probes
    - all 6 probes inserted 
    - settled probes for 30 minutes after reaching 3000 micron depth
    - minor foam in corner of eye at 01:15, clears up a bit 
    - pupil never obscured 
    - Mouse walked a little (intermittent), no running. Stationary most of the experiment 
    - First recording with new optic fiber mounts
        -frontal fiber positioned between probes E and F on tailcone (previously between F and A)

## Data Access

- **DANDI Repository**: The data from this experiment has been uploaded to the DANDI Archive and is available at: [DANDI:001637/sub-820454](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/001637/draft/files?location=sub-820454&page=1)

- **Data Format**: Data is stored in Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format.

- **Code Ocean**: Raw data (unpackaged and largely unprocessed) can be accessed on Allen Institute's Code Ocean [*Public Collection* here](https://codeocean.allenneuraldynamics.org/collections/f7b909a8-e515-4016-94ac-5487c009f20d?page=1&filter=all)

- **Analysis Code**: To explore the structure of the NWB file and validate its contents, you can use the [intro_to_ephys_nwbs](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-community-predictive-processing/blob/main/docs/notebooks/intro_to_ephys_nwbs.ipynb) script in our repository.
