# Experiment Session Notes

- **Mouse ID:*820454*
- **Date:*2025_11_04*
- **Experimenter:*Ryan Gillis*
- **Rig / Setup ID:*NP1*
- **Stimulus version:* Openscope_P3_v52 EPHYS_SESSION1_PROD_P3_SENSORYMOTOR*
- **Protocol followed:*extracellular electrophysiology*
- **Notes & Issues:**
    - first instance of using Openscope_P3_v52
    -mouse had silicone plug removal the previous Friday (membrane regrowth expected)
    - restarted all computers prior to putting the mouse on the rig
    - Ryan performed the insertion, Casey was shadowing and assisting
    - coated probes (5x dips) in CM-DiI
    - agarose + silicone oil application went smoothly
    - targeting went okay, lots of membrane on all probes
    - all 6 probes inserted 
    - settled probes for 30 minutes after reaching 3000 micron depth
    - minor foam in corner of eye at 01:15, clears up a bit 
    - pupil never obscured 
    - Mouse walked a little (intermittent), no running. Stationary most of the experiment 
    - First recording with new optic fiber mounts
        -frontal fiber positioned between probes E and F on tailcone (previously between F and A)
