# Experiment Session Notes

- **Mouse ID:*820454*
- **Date:*2025_11_07*
- **Experimenter:*Ryan Gillis*
- **Rig / Setup ID:*NP1*
- **Stimulus version:* Openscope_P3_v52 EPHYS_SESSION4_PROD_P3_DURATION*
- **Protocol followed:*extracellular electrophysiology*
- **Notes & Issues:**
    - restarted all computers prior to putting the mouse on the rig
    - Ryan performed the insertion, Casey was shadowing and assisting
    - coated probes (5x dips) in CM-DiD
    - agarose + silicone oil application went smoothly
    - lots of membrane on all probes, some altered targets
    - all 6 probes inserted 
    - settled probes for 30 minutes after reaching 3000 micron depth
    - 0:46 minor eye foam in corner, clears up but is a bit squinty afterwards
    - Mouse walked more than previously!
