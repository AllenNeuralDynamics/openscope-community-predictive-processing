# Experiment Session Notes

- **Mouse ID:*820459*
- **Date:*2025-11-10* 
- **Experimenter:*Ryan Gillis*
- **Rig / Setup ID:*NP1*
- **Stimulus version:*Openscope_P3_v52 EPHYS_SESSION1_PROD_P3_SENSORYMOTOR*
- **Protocol followed:*extracellular electrophysiology*
- **Notes & Issues:**
    - restarted all computers prior to putting the mouse on the rig
    - Ryan performed the insertion, Casey was shadowing and assisting
    - coated probes (5x dips) in CM-DiI
    - agarose + silicone oil application went smoothly
    - grounding issues before recording, troubleshooting added 10-15 minutes of rig time for mouse
    - targeting went well (no membrane)
    - all 6 probes inserted
    -Blood obscuring vasculature on hole B (from plug removal -Casey)
    -settled probes for 30 minutes after reaching 3000 micron depth
    - Mild eye foam throughout experiment (in corner of eye)
        -Ring of foam appears at 01:20:00
        -pupil never obscured
    -Mouse walked a little, no running. Stationary most of the experiment
    -First recording with new optic fibers, mounted in same position as previous week
        -power readings tested higher, visually looked bright under scope
    - brain visually healthy post experiment other than hole B
