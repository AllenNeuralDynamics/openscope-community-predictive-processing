# Experiment Session Notes

- **Mouse ID:*820459*
- **Date:*2025-11-12* 
- **Experimenter:*Ryan Gillis*
- **Rig / Setup ID:*NP1*
- **Stimulus version:*Openscope_P3_v52 EPHYS_SESSION3_PROD_P3_SEQUENCE*
- **Protocol followed:*extracellular electrophysiology*
- **Notes & Issues:**
    - restarted all computers prior to putting the mouse on the rig
    - Ryan performed the insertion, Casey was shadowing and assisting
    - coated probes (5x dips) in CM-DiD
    - agarose + silicone oil application went smoothly
    - bleed during targeting on probe E, opted to not insert
    - targeting went well on ABCDF, copied insertion location from 11/10/25 for probe D
    - 5 probes inserted (ABCDF)
    - settled probes for 30 minutes after reaching 3000 micron depth
    - Mild eye foam appears in corner of eye at 01:12
    - Foam increases at 01:23 and forms a ring around eye 
    - Pupil obscured at 01:23 until 01:28, foam ring lingers until end of experiment
    - Mouse walked a little, no running. Stationary most of the experiment
