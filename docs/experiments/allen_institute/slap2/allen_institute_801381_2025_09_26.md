# Experiment Session Notes

- **Mouse ID:** 801381
- **Date:** 2025-09-26
- **Experimenter:** @amshelton @jeromelecoq 
- **Rig / Setup ID:** SLAP2
- **Stimulus version:** https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-community-predictive-processing/blob/d17241b1abd9c3f187c6edaac62491f724ace96e/code/stimulus-control/src/Standard_oddball_slap2_version2.bonsai
- **Protocol followed:** Glutamate (Green fluorophore) imaging, 65 min experiment
- **Notes & Issues:**
    - Same experiment as last time. We record 3 behavior videos (eye, body, face) with HARP timestamps aligned with the other events.
    - Behavior camera was replaced just before the session. 
    - SLAP2 was ran with SLAP trials to avoid analysis pipeline issues (30 seconds each, longer than before). 
    - Screen is Gamma calibrated.
    - This design : https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-community-predictive-processing/discussions/98
    - Orientation 1  : 60 trials
    - Oddball block 1 : Standard 0deg (1443 trials), 45 and 90 oddballs, omission (30 trials) shuffled, Oddball occurs on average every  11s
    - Orientation 2  : 33 trials
    - Oddball block 2 : Standard 0deg (1443 trials), 0 and 45 oddballs, omission (30 trials) shuffled, Oddball occurs on average every  11s
    - Orientation 3  : 33 trials
    - Nb Receptive fields : 10
      
    Mouse head fixed at about 1:40PM
    Mouse is labelled with GluSNF4 and Rcamp3 both with viruses injection.
  
    Total Expected duration = 65 min

    We will image GluSNF4 with two photon. 

    Andrew circled few proximal dendrites and apical dendrites as well as soma. very good expression in both channels. 
  
    Experiment started at 2:18XPM.
    DMD 1 is superficial  - 70um . DMD2 is deeper - 100um

    Stimulus ended on time at around X:XX. Mice was removed from head fixation right away. No signs of stress. All 3 cameras flow recorded properly.

## Data Access

- **DANDI Repository**: The data from this experiment has been uploaded to the DANDI Archive and is available at: [DANDI:001424/sub-801381](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/001424/draft/files?location=sub-801381&page=1)

- **Data Format**: Data is stored in Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format.

- **Analysis Code**: To explore the structure of the NWB file and validate its contents, you can use the [validate_nwb_slap2.py](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-community-predictive-processing/blob/main/code/data-access/validate_nwb_slap2.py) script in our repository.

> **Disclaimer**: Please note that this is an early-stage data release. The data organization, metadata structure, and analysis tools are still being refined. If you encounter any issues or have questions about the data, please open an issue in the GitHub repository.
