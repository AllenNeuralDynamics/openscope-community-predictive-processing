# Experiment Session Notes

- **Mouse ID:** 801381
- **Date:** 2025-09-26
- **Experimenter:** @amshelton @jeromelecoq 
- **Rig / Setup ID:** SLAP2
- **Stimulus version:** https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-community-predictive-processing/blob/d17241b1abd9c3f187c6edaac62491f724ace96e/code/stimulus-control/src/Standard_oddball_slap2_version2.bonsai
- **Protocol followed:** Glutamate (Green fluorophore) imaging, 65 min experiment
- **Notes & Issues:**
    - Same experiment as last time. We record 3 behavior videos (eye, body, face) with HARP timestamps aligned with the other events.
    - Behavior camera was replaced just before the session. 
    - SLAP2 was ran with SLAP trials to avoid analysis pipeline issues (30 seconds each, longer than before). 
    - Screen is Gamma calibrated.
    - This design : https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-community-predictive-processing/discussions/98
    - Orientation 1  : 60 trials
    - Oddball block 1 : Standard 0deg (1443 trials), 45 and 90 oddballs, omission (30 trials) shuffled, Oddball occurs on average every  11s
    - Orientation 2  : 33 trials
    - Oddball block 2 : Standard 0deg (1443 trials), 0 and 45 oddballs, omission (30 trials) shuffled, Oddball occurs on average every  11s
    - Orientation 3  : 33 trials
    - Nb Receptive fields : 10
      
    Mouse head fixed at about 1:40PM
    Mouse is labelled with GluSNF4 and Rcamp3 both with viruses injection.
  
    Total Expected duration = 65 min

    We will image GluSNF4 with two photon. 

    Andrew circled few proximal dendrites and apical dendrites.
  
    DMD 1 is superficial  - XXXum . DMD2 is deeper - XXXum
    Experiment started at X:XXXPM.
  
    Stimulus ended on time at around X:XX. Mice was removed from head fixation right away. No signs of stress. All 3 cameras flow recorded properly.
