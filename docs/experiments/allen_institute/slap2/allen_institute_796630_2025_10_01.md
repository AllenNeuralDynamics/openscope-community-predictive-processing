# Experiment Session Notes

- **Mouse ID:** 796630
- **Date:** 2025-10-01
- **Experimenter:** @amshelton @jeromelecoq 
- **Rig / Setup ID:** SLAP2
- **Stimulus version:** https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-community-predictive-processing/blob/d17241b1abd9c3f187c6edaac62491f724ace96e/code/stimulus-control/src/Standard_oddball_slap2_version2.bonsai
- **Protocol followed:** Glutamate (Green fluorophore) imaging, 65 min experiment
- **Notes & Issues:**
    - Same experiment as last time. We record 3 behavior videos (eye, face, behavior) with HARP timestamps aligned with the other events.
    - Behavior camera has a flare from the eye illumination. 
    - SLAP2 was ran with SLAP trials to avoid analysis pipeline issues (30 seconds each, longer than before). 
    - Screen is Gamma calibrated.
    - This design : https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-community-predictive-processing/discussions/98
    - Orientation 1  : 60 trials
    - Oddball block 1 : Standard 0deg (1443 trials), 45 and 90 oddballs, omission (30 trials) shuffled, Oddball occurs on average every  11s
    - Orientation 2  : 33 trials
    - Oddball block 2 : Standard 0deg (1443 trials), 0 and 45 oddballs, omission (30 trials) shuffled, Oddball occurs on average every  11s
    - Orientation 3  : 33 trials
    - Nb Receptive fields : 10
      
    Mouse head fixed at 1:45PM
  
    Total Expected duration = 65 min
    We noted a little more red autofluorescence signal in this preparation than usual. This should be visible in the stack. 
    
    Male mouse is labelled with 4E12 ExP32222-hSyn-Flex-iGluSnFR4.v9601.NGR + 2E12 pAAV.CAG.Flex.RCAMP3.WPRE.SV40 + 6E8 AAV9-CamKII0.4-Cre-SV40
    injected on 4/1/2025 in V1, DOB 01/21/2025
    We will image GluSNF4 with two photon. 

    Andrew circled few proximal dendrites and apical dendrites + a band in soma.

    No issues throughout the experiment. Mouse is not stressed.
  
    DMD1 depth = 140um and DMD2 depth = 160um below the pia. Exact depth of dendrites shoudl be checked in metadata.

## Data Access

- **DANDI Repository**: The data from this experiment has been uploaded to the DANDI Archive and is available at: [DANDI:001424/sub-796630](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/001424/draft/files?location=sub-796630&page=1)

- **Data Format**: Data is stored in Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format.

- **Analysis Code**: To explore the structure of the NWB file and validate its contents, you can use the [validate_nwb_slap2.py](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-community-predictive-processing/blob/main/code/data-access/validate_nwb_slap2.py) script in our repository.

> **Disclaimer**: Please note that this is an early-stage data release. The data organization, metadata structure, and analysis tools are still being refined. If you encounter any issues or have questions about the data, please open an issue in the GitHub repository.
