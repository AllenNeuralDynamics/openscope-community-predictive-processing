# Experiment Session Notes

- **Mouse ID:** XXXXXX
- **Date:** 2025-05-29
- **Experimenter:** @Seyedolmohadesin @rcpeene @jeromelecoq Kaspar
- **Rig / Setup ID:** SLAP2
- **Stimulus version:** https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-community-predictive-processing/blob/3338a178cba99f34894657dad7eaaf872bdbe896/code/stimulus-control/src/Standard_oddball_slap2.bonsai
- **Protocol followed:** Glutamate (Green fluorophore) + Calcium (red fluorophore) imaging, 50 min experiment
- **Notes & Issues:**
    - Similar experiment as last time. This time we record all 3 behavior videos (eye, face, body) with HARP timestamps aligned with the other events.
    - SLAP2 was ran in CONTINUOUS mode, this means we now have a continuous recording, no more SLAP trials.
    - Screen is now Gamma calibrated. It was NOT before.
      
    - Baseline: 2405 -> NbBaselineGrating * (1 * (0.343+0.343)) -> 27.49 min
    - Mismatch: 40 -> NbMismatchPerCondition * 4 * (0.343+0.343)) -> 1.829 min of oddballs
    - Mismatch during orientation tuning: 40 -> 14.63 min
    - Receptive field: 10 -> NbReceptiveFieldRepeats * ((0.25) * 149) -> 6.2 min of RF
    
    Total Expected duration = 50.16 min 
    Oddball occurs on average every  11s

    - Head fixation started at XX:XX
    - Experiment started at about XX:XX
    - Apical dendrites is imaged in DMDXX.
    - Experiment went smoothly. We ended on time at XX:XX
