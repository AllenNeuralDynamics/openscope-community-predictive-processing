# Experiment Session Notes

- **Mouse ID:** 794237
- **Date:** 2025-04-03
- **Experimenter:** @Seyedolmohadesin @rcpeene @jeromelecoq @KasparP
- **Rig / Setup ID:** SLAP2
- **Stimulus version:** [30a4291398f5054fcb769db5d45e388f34dcbce2](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-community-predictive-processing/blob/30a4291398f5054fcb769db5d45e388f34dcbce2/src/Standard_oddball_slap2.bonsai)
- **Protocol followed:** Glutamate imaging, 30 min experiment
- **Notes & Issues:**
    - Virus details:
      - (pHp.eB) 5E12 ExP32222-hSyn-Flex-iGluSnFR4.v9601.NGR
      - 1E12 AAB.pHp.eB-CAG.Flex.NES.JRGECO1a.WPRE.SV40
      - 6E8 AAV.php.eB-CamK|I0.4.Cre.SV40
    - Bonsai files were changed to have clean START and STOP logging in CSV files.
    - CSV also contains START and STOP of SLAP2 as well as SPACE BAR frame number.
    - The DIO2 port is turned on when grating starts to provide accurate alignment to grating starts.
    - Stimulus has a full receptive field mapping code now pulling from a separate CSV file for all parameters.
    - Mouse:
      - C57 wild type, male, born 2025-01-07.
      - Injected with iGluSnFR4 in V1 on 2025-03-12.
    - Imaging:
      - Started at 10:39, ended at 11:13.
      - Input to BONSAI:
        - Baseline: 960
        - Mismatch: 8
        - Receptive field: 6
      - We should check code for Baseline/Mismatch ratio to guarantee the right occurrence probability.
      - Two planes chosen: Layers 2/3 cell.
      - We are approximately in V1, this is not precisely targeted in this experiment.
      - One soma and proximal dendrites in upper layers.
      - Planes are chosen by eye.
      - Dendrites are drawn by hand in proximal and apical dendrites.
      - Signal was strong, somas and dendrites clearly visible.
    - Maedeh acquired reference stacks for online motion correction.
    - Laser cooling oscillating fan caused noise every 20s (measured with watch), probably related to some feedback weight that needs to be optimized.
    - We expect this sound to be noticeable by mice.
    - Data stored at: `/allen/scratch/OpenScope/Slap2/Data/794237/`
    - Frame logging CSV file ended 2 min in due to a bug.
    - We identified the bug in the code (a TakeUntil was left with a delay).
    - The grating should still be possible to align since we have all parameters of the orientations.
    - A pulse is sent on Digital Port 2 of the Bonsai card at the start of each grating along with start and stop of SLAP2 imaging on DO0 and D01.
    - We confirmed in the file that those are present.


## Data Access

- **DANDI Repository**: The data from this experiment has been uploaded to the DANDI Archive and is available at: [DANDI:001424/sub-794237](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/001424/draft/files?location=sub-794237&page=1)

- **Data Format**: Data is stored in Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format.

- **Analysis Code**: To explore the structure of the NWB file and validate its contents, you can use the [validate_nwb_slap2.py](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-community-predictive-processing/blob/main/code/data-access/validate_nwb_slap2.py) script in our repository.

> **Disclaimer**: Please note that this is an early-stage data release. The data organization, metadata structure, and analysis tools are still being refined. If you encounter any issues or have questions about the data, please open an issue in the GitHub repository.
