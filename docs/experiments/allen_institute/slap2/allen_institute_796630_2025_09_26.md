# Experiment Session Notes

- **Mouse ID:** 796630
- **Date:** 2025-09-26
- **Experimenter:** @amshelton @jeromelecoq 
- **Rig / Setup ID:** SLAP2
- **Stimulus version:** https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-community-predictive-processing/blob/d17241b1abd9c3f187c6edaac62491f724ace96e/code/stimulus-control/src/Standard_oddball_slap2_version2.bonsai
- **Protocol followed:** Glutamate (Green fluorophore) imaging, 65 min experiment
- **Notes & Issues:**
    - Same experiment as last time. We record 2 behavior videos (eye, face) with HARP timestamps aligned with the other events.
    - Behavior camera broke during set-up (the connector disconnected inside). 
    - SLAP2 was ran with SLAP trials to avoid analysis pipeline issues (30 seconds each, longer than before). 
    - Screen is Gamma calibrated.

    - Orientation 1  : 60 trials
    - Oddball block 1 : Standard 0deg (1443 trials), 45 and 90 oddballs, omission (30 trials) shuffled, Oddball occurs on average every  11s
    - Orientation 2  : 33 trials
    - Oddball block 2 : Standard 0deg (1443 trials), 0 and 45 oddballs, omission (30 trials) shuffled, Oddball occurs on average every  11s
    - Orientation 3  : 33 trials
    - Nb Receptive fields : 10
      
    Mouse head fixed at 9:50PM
  
    Total Expected duration = 65 min

    Male mouse is labelled with 4E12 ExP32222-hSyn-Flex-iGluSnFR4.v9601.NGR + 2E12 pAAV.CAG.Flex.RCAMP3.WPRE.SV40 + 6E8 AAV9-CamKII0.4-Cre-SV40
    injected on 4/1/2025 in V1, DOB 01/21/2025
    We will image GluSNF4 with two photon. 

    Andrew circled few proximal dendrites and apical dendrites.
  
    DMD 1 is superficial  - XXXum . DMD2 is deeper - XXXum
    Experiment started at X:XXXPM.
  
    Stimulus ended on time at around X:XX. Mice was removed from head fixation right away. No signs of stress. All 3 cameras flow recorded properly.
