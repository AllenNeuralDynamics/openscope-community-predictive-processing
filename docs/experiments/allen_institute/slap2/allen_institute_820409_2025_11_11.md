# Experiment Session Notes

- **Mouse ID:** 828409
- **Date:** 2025-11-11
- **Experimenter:** @amshelton @jeromelecoq 
- **Rig / Setup ID:** SLAP2
- **Stimulus version:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-community-predictive-processing/78e1ddf12f71735cfbbebeb383eaa3389ee9dcc4/code/stimulus-control/src/Mindscope/generic_oddball_slap2.bonsai
- - **Protocol followed:** Glutamate (Green fluorophore) imaging 
- **Notes & Issues:**
    - Full length sensorimotor coupling session + control block. 
    
    Total Expected duration = 74+ min 
    - Mouse is labelled with iGluSnFR4f and rCAMP3 both with viruses injection. We will image iGluSnFR4f and rCAMP3 both with two photon.
    - Expression is good. Some scaterred particles across the surface in green channel.
    - Andrew circled the soma, a few proximal dendrites and an apical dendrites. So this experiment should yield calcium (red) + synaptic inputs (green).
    - DMD 1 is apical 110um . DMD2 is 170 um below the pia
    - Head fixation started at about 2:15PM
