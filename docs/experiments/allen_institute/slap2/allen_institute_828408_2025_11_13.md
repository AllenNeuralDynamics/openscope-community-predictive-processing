# Experiment Session Notes

- **Mouse ID:** 828408
- **Date:** 2025-11-13
- **Experimenter:** @amshelton
- **Rig / Setup ID:** SLAP2
- **Stimulus version:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-community-predictive-processing/78e1ddf12f71735cfbbebeb383eaa3389ee9dcc4/code/stimulus-control/src/Mindscope/generic_oddball_slap2.bonsai
- - **Protocol followed:** Glutamate (Green fluorophore) imaging 
- **Notes & Issues:**
    - Full length sensorimotor coupling session + control block. 
    - This day 1 failed the day before due to motion correction issue so we are attempting is again.
    - We modified the worflow very slightly to give more time to save files (1 to 10seconds). Files were saved previously but bonsai did not close. 
    Total Expected duration = 74+ min 
    - Mouse is labelled with iGluSnFR4f and rCAMP3 both with viruses injection. We will image iGluSnFR4f and rCAMP3 both with two photon. Expression is rather sparse.
    - DMD 1 is apical 50um . DMD2 is 25um below the pia
    - Experiment went al the way, no isues. We had to abort CTRL-C bonsai hanging thread but it saved the data correctly.
    - Small adjustement to field of view
    - Power was turned from 100% to 75% about a 20 min in. Andrew noticed a bit of bleaching.
    - Mouse shows weaks signs of stress (tears in the eye 15min in). It cleared out eventually.
    - Mouse is walking at the end. Not at the onset.
