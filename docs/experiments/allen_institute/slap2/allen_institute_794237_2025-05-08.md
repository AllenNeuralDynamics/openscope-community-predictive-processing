# Experiment Session Notes

- **Mouse ID:** 794237
- **Date:** 2025-05-08
- **Experimenter:** @Seyedolmohadesin @rcpeene @jeromelecoq @amshelton
- **Rig / Setup ID:** SLAP2
- **Stimulus version:** [523741b57359b8ad4ca7963611473fbb195ad010]( https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-community-predictive-processing/blob/523741b57359b8ad4ca7963611473fbb195ad010/code/stimulus-control/src/Standard_oddball_slap2.bonsai)
- **Protocol followed:** Glutamate imaging, 50 min experiment
- **Notes & Issues:**
    - Similar experiment as last time. This time we record all 3 behavior videos (eye, face, body) with HARP timestamps aligned with the other events.
    
    - Baseline: 2405 -> NbBaselineGrating * (1 * (0.343+0.343)) -> 27.49 min
    - Mismatch: 40 -> NbMismatchPerCondition * 4 * (0.343+0.343)) -> 1.829 min of oddballs
    - Mismatch during orientation tuning: 40 -> 14.63 min
    - Receptive field: 10 -> NbReceptiveFieldRepeats * ((0.25) * 149) -> 6.2 min of RF
    
    Total Expected duration = 50.16 min 
    Oddball occurs on average every  11s

    - Head fixation started at 13:55
    - Lot of issues with alignment of the eye tracking cameras. We managed at 14:25 to align the camera.
    - There is a fair amout of 2p cross talk to the behavior cameras. We will need to add a filter to remove it.
    - Otherwise all 3 cameras are functions.
    - Andrew is positioning imaging of dendrites at 2:40. 
    - Maedeh weighting on choices of dendrites.
    - Experiment started at about 2;50. 
    - Apical dendrites is imaged in DMD2.
    - Next experiment we will add filter to remove cross talk from 2p and control stimulus screen cross talk. 

    - Experiment went smoothly. We ended on time at 3:42
    - Reviewing behavior videos show no signs of stress. 


## Data Access

- **DANDI Repository**: The data from this experiment has been uploaded to the DANDI Archive and is available at: [DANDI:001424/sub-794237](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/001424/draft/files?location=sub-794237&page=1)

- **Data Format**: Data is stored in Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format.
