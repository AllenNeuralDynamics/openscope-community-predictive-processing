# Experiment Session Notes

- **Mouse ID:** 794237
- **Date:** 2025-04-24
- **Experimenter:** @Seyedolmohadesin @rcpeene @jeromelecoq @KasparP
- **Rig / Setup ID:** SLAP2
- **Stimulus version:** 
- **Protocol followed:** Glutamate imaging, 50 min experiment
- **Notes & Issues:**
  
     - Code was modified to have a drifting duration of 343 ms followed by 343 ms duration gray. Receptive Field gratings are 250ms each now. Previously we had 1s seconds in between 250ms gratings. So this protocol is more faithful to our plan with many more grating presented.
     - Formula for stimulus duration : NbBaselineGrating * (1 * (0.343+0.343)) + NbMismatchPerCondition * (16 * (0.343+0.343) + 16 * (0.343+0.343) + 4 * (0.343+0.343)) + NbReceptiveFieldRepeats * ((0.25) * 149)
     - Any Oddball occurrence probability is 4 * NbMismatchPerCondition / NbBaselineGrating * 100
     - A given Oddball occurence probablity is NbMismatchPerCondition / (NbBaselineGrating) * 100
     - We shoot for a full session
 
        Baseline: 2405 -> NbBaselineGrating * (1 * (0.343+0.343)) -> 27.49 min 
        Mismatch: 40 -> NbMismatchPerCondition * 4 * (0.343+0.343)) -> 1.829 min of oddballs
        Mismatch during orientation tuning: 40 -> 14.63 min
        Receptive field: 10 -> NbReceptiveFieldRepeats * ((0.25) * 149) -> 6.2 min of RF
    
    Total Expected duration = 50.16 min 
    Oddball occurs on average every  11s

      - Head fixation starts at 1:35 PM
      - We are using VIMBA camera to record face.
      - A LED to illumainate the mouse was turned on (850nm)
      - Maedeh is targetting a rather superficial neurons with a very clear long apical dendrite in the layer I.
      - Maedeh takes reference stack at 2:07PM
