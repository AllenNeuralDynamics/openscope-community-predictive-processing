## Meeting Notes 

**Meeting Agenda**: Jerome outlined the meeting agenda, which includes presentations by Nicholas, Sarah, and Jerome on various analyses and experimental designs. 

Agenda Overview: Jerome outlined the meeting agenda, which includes presentations by Nicholas on population level analysis, Sarah on individual ROI analysis, and Jerome on experimental design variants. 

Presentation Details: Jerome mentioned that Nicholas would present analysis on slap two data, Sarah would present her findings, and Jerome would discuss different variants of the experimental design conducted. 

Discussion Format: Jerome explained the format of sharing presentations prior to the meeting to facilitate in-depth discussions during the meeting. 


**Population Level Analysis**: Nicholas presented his population level analysis on slap two data, discussing preprocessing steps, tuning preferences, and the impact of photo bleaching on amplitude. 

Preprocessing Steps: Nicholas described the preprocessing steps, including normalization by baseline F0 and selection of ROIs based on orientation tuning preference changes after the oddball block presentation. 

Photo Bleaching Impact: Nicholas discussed the impact of photo bleaching on amplitude and how he addressed it by focusing on the shape of the ROI tuning vector rather than amplitude. 

Tuning Preferences: Nicholas explained how he calculated the tuning spread per ROI and performed min-max scaling to address photo bleaching, focusing on the shape of the ROI tuning vector. 

Orientation Tuning: Nicholas explained how he calculated the tuning spread per ROI and performed min-max scaling to address photo bleaching, focusing on the shape of the ROI tuning vector. 

Tuning Spread Calculation: Nicholas calculated the tuning spread per ROI by determining the maximum and minimum values for each peristimulus window and retaining ROIs in the top 25% of the tuning spread distribution. 

Min-Max Scaling: Nicholas performed ROI-wise min-max scaling to rescale every orientation tuning vector between zero and one per ROI to address photo bleaching. 

Orientation Tuning Vector: Nicholas focused on the shape of the ROI tuning vector to mitigate the impact of photo bleaching on amplitude measurements. 


**Radar Plots**: Nicholas shared radar plots to visualize changes in orientation tuning after the presentation of the oddball block, noting patterns of multiple stimuli tuning and dominant tuning changes. 

Radar Plot Visualization: Nicholas shared radar plots to visualize changes in orientation tuning after the presentation of the oddball block, noting patterns of multiple stimuli tuning and dominant tuning changes. 

Multiple Stimuli Tuning: Nicholas observed that certain ROIs exhibited tuning to multiple stimuli and changed their tuning after the oddball block presentation. 

Dominant Tuning Changes: Nicholas noted that some ROIs had one dominant tuning that changed significantly after the oddball block presentation. 


**PCA Analysis**: Nicholas used PCA to analyze changes in orientation tuning vectors, aiming to identify dominant covariance modes and patterns of change across multiple orientations. 

PCA Methodology: Nicholas used PCA to compute the cross covariance matrix between pre and post oddball block orientation tuning vectors to identify dominant covariance modes. 

Covariance Modes: Nicholas aimed to identify whether changes in orientation tuning vectors exhibited dominant covariance modes focused on single or multiple orientations. 

Pattern Analysis: Nicholas analyzed patterns of change across multiple orientations using PCA, noting that changes were not focused on a single orientation but rather across multiple orientations. 


**Plotting Issues**: Lucas and Alexander raised concerns about plotting issues related to orientation angles and the use of direction versus orientation in the analysis. 

Orientation Angles: Lucas and Alexander raised concerns about the accuracy of orientation angles in the radar plots, suggesting potential issues with the conversion of direction to orientation angles. 

Direction vs Orientation: Lucas and Alexander discussed the difference between direction and orientation angles, highlighting the need to ensure correct computation and plotting in the analysis. 


**Control Trials**: Nicholas emphasized the need for control trials to enable a more robust population level analysis and address potential biases in the PCA process. 

Need for Controls: Nicholas emphasized the importance of control trials to enable a more robust population level analysis and address potential biases in the PCA process. 

Bias Concerns: Nicholas discussed concerns about potential biases in the PCA process and the need for control trials to mitigate these biases. 


**Gain Modulation**: Sarah presented her analysis on individual ROI level, highlighting a marked gain modulation of synaptic strength in Block 2 compared to Block 1. 

Synaptic Strength: Sarah highlighted a marked gain modulation of synaptic strength in Block 2 compared to Block 1, noting that the response amplitude in Block 2 was consistently smaller. 

Response Amplitude: Sarah observed that the response amplitude of Delta F/F was almost always smaller in Block 2 compared to Block 1, indicating a gain modulation effect. 

Normalization Method: Sarah explained her normalization method, peak normalizing responses to the maximum response across both blocks to illustrate gain changes. 


**Orientation Selectivity**: Sarah discussed the orientation selectivity index for each ROI, noting that while most ROIs remain stable, some exhibit dramatic changes in selectivity. 

Selectivity Index: Sarah discussed the orientation selectivity index for each ROI, noting that while most ROIs remain stable, some exhibit dramatic changes in selectivity. 

Stable ROIs: Sarah observed that the majority of ROIs remained stable in their orientation selectivity index across blocks. 

Dramatic Changes: Sarah noted that some ROIs exhibited dramatic changes in their orientation selectivity index, either losing or gaining selectivity. 


**Preferred Orientation**: Sarah visualized the preferred orientation for each ROI, showing that while many ROIs do not change their preference, some exhibit significant shifts. 

Preferred Orientation: Sarah visualized the preferred orientation for each ROI, showing that while many ROIs do not change their preference, some exhibit significant shifts. 

Stable Preferences: Sarah noted that many ROIs did not change their preferred orientation across blocks. 

Significant Shifts: Sarah observed that some ROIs exhibited significant shifts in their preferred orientation, indicating changes in tuning. 


**Response Strength**: Sarah highlighted the consistent change in response strength across sessions, with many ROIs showing a scaled-down response amplitude in Block 2. 

Consistent Change: Sarah highlighted the consistent change in response strength across sessions, with many ROIs showing a scaled-down response amplitude in Block 2. 

Scaled-Down Amplitude: Sarah observed that many ROIs showed a scaled-down response amplitude in Block 2 compared to Block 1. 

Session Consistency: Sarah noted that the change in response strength was consistent across different sessions, indicating a robust effect. 


**Receptive Field Mapping**: Participants discussed the importance of receptive field mapping as a sanity check and potential internal control for plasticity analysis. 

Sanity Check: Participants discussed the importance of receptive field mapping as a sanity check to ensure the accuracy of synaptic input localization. 

Plasticity Control: Participants considered receptive field mapping as a potential internal control for analyzing plasticity effects in synaptic inputs. 


**Experimental Design Variants**: Jerome presented several experimental design variants to control for learning effects and contextual modulation, seeking feedback on the most important controls. 


**Statistical Power Analysis**: Lucas and Nicholas agreed to collaborate on statistical power analysis to determine the number of trials needed for reliable measurements in different blocks.
