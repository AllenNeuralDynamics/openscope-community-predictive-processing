**Contributing Experimental Data:**

1.  **Discuss First:** *Before* collecting or submitting data, please contact members of the team to discuss how your experiment aligns with project goals.
2.  **Use the Template:** Document your experimental session using the provided [Experiment Template](template-files/mouse_experiment_template.md). Name the file `<institute>_<mouse_id>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.
3.  **Submit Documentation:** Add your completed experiment markdown file to the `docs/experiments/` directory via a Pull Request.
4.  **Coordinate Data Transfer:** Work with the contact person to arrange the transfer of the actual experimental data according to agreed-upon methods.

**Improving Documentation:**

*   Found a typo, an unclear explanation, or missing information?
*   You can either:
    *   Create an issue describing the problem.
    *   Submit a Pull Request directly with your suggested fix to the relevant `.md` file in the `docs/` directory.
