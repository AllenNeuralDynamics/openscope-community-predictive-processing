## Project Management Workflow

We use a [GitHub Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/AllenNeuralDynamics/projects/149/views/4) to track individual tickets and provide visibility into the progress of the project. The board organizes tickets added to the repository and follows a standard workflow.

### Workflow Overview:
1. **Create a GitHub Issue**:
    - Each task or deliverable should be created as a GitHub issue in the repository.
    - Clearly define the task, its scope, and any relevant details.
    - Provide estimated start and end dates, to be updated as the project progresses.
    - Assign the issue to the appropriate team member(s) and indicate the Laboratory that will be performing the task.
    - Use labels to categorize issues (e.g., `data-analysis`, `stimulus-design`, `documentation`).

2. **Track on the Kanban Board**:
    - All issues are automatically added to the [Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/AllenNeuralDynamics/projects/149/views/7).
    - The board is organized into columns representing different stages of the workflow:
        - **To Do**: Tasks that are planned but not yet started.
        - **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on.
        - **Review**: Tasks that are completed and awaiting review.
        - **Done**: Tasks that are completed and approved.

3. **Update Regularly**:
    - Team members should update the status of their issues on the Kanban board as they progress through the workflow.
    - Add comments to issues to provide updates or request feedback.

## Data Collection and Management Projects

### Project 1: Data Collection and Stimulus Design

**🎯 Title & Goal:**  
*Design and implement stimuli for investigating predictive processing mechanisms across multiple experimental paradigms.*

**👥 Contributors:**  
@jeromelecoq @rcpeene

**📝 Description:**  
This project focuses on developing and implementing four key experimental paradigms to investigate different aspects of predictive processing:
 
1. **Standard Mismatch**: Habituating animals to drifting gratings of the same orientation with occasional mismatch stimuli
2. **Sensorimotor Mismatch**: Establishing closed-loop visuo-motor interactions with occasional mismatches
3. **Sequence Mismatch**: Testing responses to disruptions in learned sequences of stimuli
4. **Temporal Mismatch**: Investigating responses to unexpected timing changes in sensory inputs

Each stimulus paradigm is implemented in Bonsai and includes appropriate control conditions to isolate specific predictive mechanisms.

**Progress:**
- ✅ Standard oddball and sensorimotor oddball stimuli implemented in Bonsai
- ✅ Initial SLAP2 recordings completed with mouse #794237 and #787727
- 🔄 Ongoing refinement of temporal mismatch stimuli

### Project 2: Data Curation and Sharing

**🎯 Title & Goal:**  
*Ensure all data and metadata are properly curated, formatted, and shared through public repositories.*

**👥 Contributors:**  
@jeromelecoq @rcpeene

**📝 Description:**  
This project focuses on the critical task of data management, ensuring that all datasets are released without embargo, following the community policy.  
This includes standardizing data in NWB format, uploading datasets to the Allen Institute or DANDI/NWB archives, and providing comprehensive documentation.

Key data types include:
- Two-photon calcium imaging data from pan-excitatory and pan-inhibitory lines
- Neuropixels recordings with SST-optotagging
- Voltage imaging recordings of pyramidal cell somata and dendrites

**Progress:**
- 🔄 Initial data curation pipeline established
- 🔄 Working on metadata standardization for SLAP2 experiments

## Analysis Projects (Aligned with Analysis Plan)

### Project 3: Information Encoding in Mismatch Responses

**🎯 Title & Goal:**  
*Determine what kind of information is encoded by mismatch responses across different experimental paradigms.*

**👥 Contributors:**  
*Seeking contributors*

**📝 Description:**  
This project addresses the first main question in our analysis plan: "What kind of information is encoded by mismatch responses?" We will analyze how neurons represent prediction errors by distinguishing between:

1. **Multiplicative Novelty**:
   - Analyze whether mismatch responses scale with tuning curve preference
   - Fit tuning curves with multiplicative gain parameters
   - Test if neurons with strong preference for standard stimuli show larger mismatch responses

2. **Additive Novelty**:
   - Test if mismatch responses reflect a generalized "alert" signal
   - Evaluate whether responses increase uniformly across all stimulus conditions
   - Fit tuning curves with additive offset parameters

3. **Subtractive Novelty (True Prediction Error)**:
   - Quantify if responses represent the difference between expected and actual stimuli
   - Build predictive models of expected neural activity and compare with actual activity
   - Test if response magnitude correlates with feature distance between expected and actual stimuli

**Analysis Methods:**
- Event-triggered averaging for calcium imaging data
- Peri-stimulus time histograms for Neuropixels data
- Tuning curve analysis with parametric models
- Bootstrap resampling for statistical validation

   - Test if predictive signals differ across visual features (orientation, motion)
