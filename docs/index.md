# OpenScope Community Predictive Processing

Welcome to the **OpenScope Community Predictive Processing** repository! This project is part of the Allen Institute's initiative to foster collaboration and innovation in predictive processing research. The repository serves as a hub for community-driven contributions, documentation, and project tracking.

## Scientific Context

This project is described in the paper [Neural mechanisms of predictive processing: a collaborative community experiment through the OpenScope program](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09614). The paper explores how predictive processing mechanisms in the brain can be studied using community-driven experiments, leveraging tools like in-vivo two-photon imaging and electrophysiological recordings.

Predictive processing theorizes that the brain continuously predicts sensory inputs, refining neuronal responses by minimizing prediction errors.

The collaborative experiment described in the [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09614) proposes testing mechanisms behind predictive processing using temporal, motor, and omission mismatch stimuli in mice and primates. The resulting datasets, shared via the OpenScope program, and from collaborating laboratories, aims to foster community analysis and iterative refinement of predictive processing models.
