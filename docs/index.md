# OpenScope Community Predictive Processing

Welcome to the **OpenScope Community Predictive Processing** repository! This project is part of the Allen Institute's initiative to foster collaboration and innovation in predictive processing research. The repository serves as a hub for community-driven contributions, documentation, and project tracking.

This project is described in the paper [Neural mechanisms of predictive processing: a collaborative community experiment through the OpenScope program](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09614). The paper explores how predictive processing mechanisms in the brain can be studied using community-driven experiments, leveraging tools like in-vivo two-photon imaging and electrophysiological recordings.

## About the Project

This repository is dedicated to advancing research in predictive processing through community collaboration. It includes:
- Guidelines for contributing to the project.
- Documentation for experimental stimuli and tools.
- A centralized location for tracking project progress and team contributions.

For more details, see the [Project Tracking](project-tracking.md) document.

## Scientific Context

Predictive processing theorizes that the brain continuously predicts sensory inputs, refining neuronal responses by minimizing prediction errors. This framework likely relies on key computational primitives, such as:
- **Stimulus adaptation**
- **Dendritic computation**
- **Excitatory/inhibitory balance**
- **Hierarchical processing**

The collaborative experiment described in the [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09614) proposes testing these mechanisms using temporal, motor, and omission mismatch stimuli in mice and primates. The resulting dataset, shared via the OpenScope program, aims to foster community analysis and iterative refinement of predictive processing models.
