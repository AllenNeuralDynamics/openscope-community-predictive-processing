# Standard Oddball Stimulus with Jittered Intervals

## Overview

The Standard Oddball Stimulus with Jittered Intervals is an enhanced version of the standard oddball paradigm that introduces predetermined but variable inter-stimulus intervals. 

## Script Location

The stimulus script is located at:
- [`/code/stimulus-control/src/Standard_oddball_slap2_jitter_random.bonsai`](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-community-predictive-processing/blob/main/code/stimulus-control/src/Standard_oddball_slap2_jitter_random.bonsai)

## Hardware Requirements

- SLAP2 imaging system
- Behavior device with encoder/wheel for tracking animal movement
- Digital outputs (DO2) for synchronization with recording equipment

## Stimulus Parameters

### Basic Parameters
- **Display Type**: Drifting gratings
- **Spatial Frequency**: 0.04 cycles per degree
- **Temporal Frequency**: 2 Hz (standard)
- **Contrast**: 1.0 (full contrast)
- **Size**: 360° (full-field gratings)
- **Stimulus Duration**: 343 ms (fixed)
- **Inter-stimulus Intervals**: Four predefined values (0.343s, 1s, 1.5s, 2s)

### Configurable Parameters
The script contains several externalized parameters that can be adjusted:
- `NbBaselineGrating`: Number of standard gratings (default: 20)
- `NbMismatchPerCondition`: Number of repetitions for each deviant condition (default: 1)
- `NbReceptiveFieldRepeats`: Number of repetitions for receptive field mapping (default: 1)

## Experimental Design

### 1. Orientation Tuning Component with Jittered Intervals
This experiment includes presentation of 16 different orientations (0°, 22.5°, 45°, etc.) with a systematic jitter implementation:

- Each orientation is paired with each of the four possible inter-stimulus intervals (0.343s, 1s, 1.5s, 2s)
- This creates 64 unique orientation-delay pairs (16 orientations × 4 delays)
- The entire set of these pairs is randomized using a permutation algorithm
- This ensures each orientation is shown at each possible delay, but the sequence is unpredictable

The jitter is not randomly chosen at runtime; instead, each orientation appears four times in the randomized sequence, each time with a different predefined delay.

### 2. Standard-Oddball Paradigm
The core of the experiment consists of:

- **Standard Stimulus**: 0° orientation grating with 2 Hz temporal frequency (repeated ~20 times)
- **Deviant Stimuli**: 
    - **Orientation deviants**: 45° and 90° oriented gratings
    - **Temporal frequency deviant**: 0 Hz (stationary grating at 0° orientation)
    - **Contrast deviant**: 0 contrast (blank screen) with 2 Hz temporal frequency

The jittered intervals break the rhythmic presentation pattern found in the standard oddball paradigm, which helps isolate responses to stimulus features from responses to stimulus timing.

### 3. Receptive Field Mapping
The experiment includes a mapping component with smaller gratings (20° diameter) presented at locations defined in `receptive_field.csv`. These specialized mapping gratings have:
- Higher spatial frequency (0.08 cpd)
- Higher temporal frequency (4 Hz)
- Higher contrast (0.8)
- Shorter duration (250 ms)
- No inter-stimulus interval (0 ms delay)

## Data Collection

The script logs all stimulus parameters and timing information to CSV files:
- `orientations_logger.csv`: Contains timing of stimulus events
- `vstimLog.csv`: Records the detailed parameters of each stimulus presentation, including the specific delay used for each stimulus

Animal running data is collected via an encoder on Port 2 of the behavior device.

## Synchronization
- TTL pulses (100ms) are generated at stimulus onset via DO2 output
- SLAP2 recording is automatically started and stopped during the experiment

## Running the Experiment
1. Start the Bonsai workflow
2. Press the spacebar to begin the experiment
3. The experiment can be terminated with the End key
