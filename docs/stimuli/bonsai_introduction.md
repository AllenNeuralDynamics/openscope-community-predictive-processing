# Introduction to Bonsai

Bonsai is a visual reactive programming language that's particularly powerful for neuroscience applications, data acquisition, and behavioral control. This page provides an introduction to Bonsai and resources to help you get started.

## What is Bonsai?

Bonsai is an open-source visual programming language for processing data streams and controlling real-time experiments, particularly in neuroscience and behavioral research contexts. It employs a reactive programming paradigm that makes it ideal for:

- Video and image processing
- Data acquisition from various sensors
- Designing interactive experiments
- Creating closed-loop behavioral paradigms
- Visual stimulus presentation

## Introduction Video

This video provides an excellent introduction to Bonsai and its capabilities:
