# Hardware Overview

This page provides a brief introduction to the specialized hardware systems used in the OpenScope Community Predictive Processing project at the Allen Institute. For detailed specifications and technical information, please follow the links to each system's dedicated documentation page.

## Recording Systems

The project employs three advanced neural recording platforms, each offering unique capabilities for studying predictive processing at different scales.

### SLAP2 (Swept Line Active Polarization)

The SLAP2 microscope is designed for ultra-fast subcellular imaging, capable of recording from arbitrary sets of pixels across multiple sample planes at speeds up to 220 Hz.

### Neuropixels Probes

Neuropixels technology enables high-density electrophysiological recordings with hundreds of simultaneous recording sites distributed across multiple brain regions, providing millisecond-precision spike timing.
